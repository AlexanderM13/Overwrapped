Couch co-op game up to 4 players! Inspired from the popular multiplayer/co-op game Overcooked.
The game follows the story of our four protagonists, Jingle, Mingle, Tingle, and Kringle. All brothers born together in the candy cane village from the North Pole, They all had the dream of working for Santa Claus one day. Nowadays, these four are one of Santaâ€™s most trustworthy elves, and Santa has given them the task to create enough toys to give around all kids in the world. However, because Christmas is coming soon, they are in a time crunch, and are constantly trying to find ways to work together to get all the toys assembled in time. Due to the season being in the Winter, the North Pole becomes pretty hectic around this time of the year, and there are many obstacles such as windstorms, water leaks, freezing, etc, that might delay our heroes from assembling all the toys in time. With Santa Claus enlisting these four with the utmost trust to have enough toys for when Christmas rolls around, will these four elves prove to Santa Claus why they can be 
trusted, or will this Christmas be the last time they work for Santa Claus.
